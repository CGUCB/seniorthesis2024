# L&S Data Science Senior Thesis Research Project
## Efficient Neural Architecture Search
This project focused on utilizing Zero-Shot NAS, Bayesian Optimization, and Evolutionary Techniques to quickly search for Optimal Network Architecture. The Thesis will start with MLPs, and expand into CNNs, RNNs, GRUs, and various other styles of architectures using the same fundamental concepts. This project is not a library but a demonstration of possible gains in preformance from optimizing a network for the given task at hand (rather than relying on human experts or ready-made designs). The created arhcitectures will be evluated on industry standard benchmarks and/or widely avalible datasets.

## Directory Structure
| Folder | Description |
|-----|-----|
| `data`  | Will have all data used for testing and training purposes; sources of the data are included in the folder  |
| `notebooks`  | Includes Reproduction Analysis, Pre-Analysis Plan, and Analysis Work |
| `additional work`  | Includes non-notebook files that are needed in Analysis Work (i.e. Saved network architecture, Saved network weights) |
| `images`  | Contaisn any outside images used in the notebooks or otherwise  |
| `output`  | Output Test Data (same as original, for demo purposes) in CSV and TSV format  |
| `subassignments`  | Markdown files with submissions for final project sub-assignments  |

### Pre-Analysis Plan

| Section | Description |
|-----|-----|
| Abstract  | an abstract for your project, excl. findings  |
| Data  | description of your data set (something akin to a synthesis of the Step 1 assignment)  |
| Strategy  | an outline of the steps you will take to analyze your data (mostly a description of the code)  |
| Analysis  | any heuristics or mathematical models that you use, and the reasons for their use  |
| Deliverables  | a description of the deliverable files in the repo, incl. where your presentation is  |
| Sources   | list of sources for your data _and any other research_ that you did  |
